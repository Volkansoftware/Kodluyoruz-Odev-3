   <p>Becoming an elite rower takes years of hard training and it is usually the athletes with longer experience who achieve the best results. The senior World Rowing Championships are held every year and World Champions are crowned in 12 men's boat classes and nine women's boat classes. These include Olympic and International boat classes</p>
